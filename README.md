## Predicting Forest Fire Probability in your location â€“ Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask, HTML 


#### This website will predicts the percentage of a forest fire happening in your place based on oxygen,temperature and humidity content made using Logistic Regression in Python and Flask.*[ Web link ](https://predictforestfire.herokuapp.com/) 

#### Dataset: Used dataset from Kaggle 

#### Implemented Logistic regression for prediction. 
#### Performed data analysis and identified the relation of oxygen, temperature, and humidity in predicting the chance of wildfire around a given location. Used Logistic Regression on dataset to predict the probability of occurrence of fire.
#### Created a web page for predicting probability of Wildfire on providing 3 features input value. Also published it as standalone web page using Flask on Heroku.

#### This project can help in effective evacuation when risk of forest fire is high.
